# Extension

The SugarDB command list is always growing, but we realise that it may not provide an exhaustive list of commands. If you're switching from Redis, then there are a lot of commands that may be missing in SugarDB.

As we continue to develop SugarDB and add built-in commands, we also provide a few ways in which you can extend SugarDB's functionality to add more commands.

There are multiple ways to extend SugarDB:

1. Using the <a href="/docs/extension/embedded">embedded API</a>.
2. Using <a href="/docs/extension/shared_object">shared object plugins</a>.
3. Using Lua modules (Coming).
