    - "nopass" if the user has no passwords (and NoPass is true).
    - "categories" - string slice af ACL command categories associated with the user. 
    If the user is allowed to access all categories, it will contain "+@*".
    For each category the user is allowed to access, the slice will contain "+@\<category\>".
    If the user is not allowed to access any categories, it will contain "-@*".
    For each category the user is not allowed to access, the slice will contain "-@\<category\>".
    - "commands" - string slice af commands associated with the user.
    If the user is allowed to execute all commands, it will contain "+all".

    If the user is not allowed to execute any commands, it will contain "-all".
    For each command the user is not allowed to execute, the slice will contain "-\<category\>".
    - "keys" - string slice af keys associated with the user.
    If the user is allowed read/write access all keys, the slice will contain "%RW~*".
    For each key glob pattern the user has read/write access to, the slice will contain "%RW~\<pattern\>".
    If the user is allowed read access to all keys, the slice will contain "%R~*".
    For each key glob pattern the user has read access to, the slice will contain "%R~\<pattern\>".
    If the user is allowed write access to all keys, the slice will contain "%W~*".
    For each key glob pattern the user has write access to, the slice will contain "%W~\<pattern\>".
    - "channels" - string slice af pubsub channels associated with the user.
    If the user is allowed to access all channels, the slice will contain "+&*".
